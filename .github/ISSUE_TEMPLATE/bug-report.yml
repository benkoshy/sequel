        ## Bugs Only
        If you have
          - a question, or need help,
          - or want to request a feature,
          - or do anything else other than submit a bug report, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/discussions) or the [sequel-talk Google Group  (A Question / Answer Forum)](https://groups.google.com/g/sequel-talk). Why? To protect the maintainer's  time, and (2) as an added incentive, there are many folks watching the discussion board - who will likely point you in the right direction if they know the answer.
