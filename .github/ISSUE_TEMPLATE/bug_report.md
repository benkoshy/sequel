If you have:
* a question, or need help,
* or want to request a feature, 
* or do anything else other than submit a bug report, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/discussions) or the sequel-talk Google Group. Why? To protect the maintainer's  time, and (2) as an added incentive, there are many folks watching the discussion board - who will likely point you in the right direction if they know the answer.
